# Introduction

DeeJayChow (I'm the DJ in this case..) is an full stack application that implements the client-server architecture for users (client) to request music to be added to a spotify queue (server's spotify play queue). The goal of this app is to allow friends and families to have a collective aux at an event.

## Dedepency

The app uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJs) and also Redis, therefore if you would like to host the server, you'll need to install all of these dependencies.
